            <p>
              Weâ€™ve secured a block of rooms at the Eastgate Hotel in Oxford at a discounted rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hotel has a nice lounge area, and there are a number of cafes and restaurants within a short walk. We're hoping to have as many people stay there as possible, so we can spend time with people while things are a bit quieter.
            </p>
            <p>
              There should be enough rooms for everyone who wants to stay, but we will need to finalise the booking in early July. If you want a room, please let us know when you RSVP!
